Don't Do It

I can't sit inside the time machine 
I've been stuck in space for several weeks 
I could not believe the final word 
I could not believe what had occurred 

You could not decide the path to take 
You would not discern from real and fake 
You could not believe the final word 
You could not believe what had occurred 

And it was all so scary that my head blew into bits 
The spaceship launched out early 
When the words had left your lips 
Back at base the crew did all they could to save the day 
But you were out too far to hear the other people say 'hey, don't do it!' 

Headlong we dive into the stratosphere 
With haste you make the badness disappear 
No more we need a space where we can breathe 
No more another plot that's ill conceived
