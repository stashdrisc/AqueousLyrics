What's the Connection?

What's the connection? 
Because I don't see it anymore (Four Five years been gone now) 
What's the connection? 
Because I don't feel it anymore 

You can be wrong no matter which side you're on 
It doesn't matter much, it doesn't matter much 
Venture outside of what you think you know 
There are so many places to go 

Give me a call when if you get back from outer space 
Drop me a line when if you crash on by
