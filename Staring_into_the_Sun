Staring into the Sun

 

I didn't ever go that far

I did it all underground

Pawned what I could to stay at par

I didn't ever hear the sound

 

And they went and threw their stones

From atop the highest trees 

But if the future met the past it’d be better known

That their disease was hard to please

 

Reeling in the drive to talk, drive to walk

It’s a fitting masquerade

Throwing darts at the hearts of the many in the way

Of the grand new paper day

 

Staring into the sun all over again

That’s my dream

In through the out, out through the in

That’s my dream
