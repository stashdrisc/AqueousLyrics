Dr. Brox (Doctor Brox)

Dr. Brox and his Bankers Box and his world filled with toys 
Toys for me and toys for you, to help get you through 
The day to night and the night to day 
All I can say is that it's ok	I don't know your answers and I don't know your questions 
Why should I ever speak? 

Searching through the garden for some souls today 
To hide them away until the month of May 
When I come out, out to play	I'd like you all to join me then 
When the colors are bright and everyone can see the light 
You don't need to know the design	You just got to know 

Dr. Brox could you help me please 
Dr. Brox I'm down on my knees 
Dr. Brox could you help me to pave the way 
Dr. Brox what's inside the box? 

Dr. Brox and his Bankers Box and he's sitting up on the hill 
Well he's watching the sunrise and watching the sun fall 
As he goes down, down, down, down, down 
He's a man you must believe, he's a guy that can truly see 
You call him up anytime 
You just got to know 

Some people say he was all alone 
Shifting tides and old alibis was his gold 
So let these sounds take ya home 
A home that's new to you
