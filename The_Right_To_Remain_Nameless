The Right to Remain Nameless

I've got my shoes tied tight 
I'm talkin double knot 
The triple loop-d-loop 
Cause i like to walk a lot 
Cause i've got a place to be 
But you can't come with me 
Cause i'm going on my own

And when i go i'll save things i found along the way 
to bring back home to you
