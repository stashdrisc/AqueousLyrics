LITTLE SOMETHING TO ME

What are you waiting for?
Don’t throw this time away
A little push to the edge got you thinking that tomorrow won’t come around anyway

I get no love from you
Have you got something that you need to say?
A little push to the edge but I’m feeling like a million, a million anyway

(Yeah)
(Yeah)

One look
One heart 
One dream

It doesn’t mean that much to you, but it means a little something to me

One hit
One shot 
One to be

It doesn’t mean that much to you, but it means a little something to me

What was that thing you said?
It was just yesterday
Feeling like i’ve got an ultimatum on my plate 
but i’ll get you on top now, anyway

And if you think of me,
then think some other way
Cause’ I’m in a position to assess that was given wasn’t really ever for me anyway

You can’t see
What’s the point anymore?
I won’t wait
There’s the door, there’s the door
I know 
Your time has come, time has come
You can’t let go 

One look
One heart 
One dream

It doesn’t mean that much to you, but it means a little something to me

One hit
One shot 
One to be
