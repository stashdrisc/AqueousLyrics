Falling

I tried my hand and made a plan 
But it just fell apart 
It's just too hard to get you right 
And I can't find the way 
But if you see me falling then you know I won't get up 

In life you learn to work it out 
But often times you'll fail 
And half the time we criticize 
Instead of watching out for your mistakes 
But if you see me falling then you know I won't get up 

So if it's all inside the mind 
And all the fears I had inside 
Won't manifest until I die 
Was it even worth the time 

The days will change but I'm the same 
And nothing here was real 
And all the walls come crashing down 
And I just can't get out 
But if you see me falling then you know I won't get up 

So if I ever get the time	I'll try to make it worth your while 
I'll keep on running till I die 
Was it even worth the time
