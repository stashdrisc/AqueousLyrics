Eon Don

I know you're one of those cats who never really had alot going on 
While you're sitting at home on your overgrown throne going by the name of Eon Don 
Send me a line, don't send me a verse until you've got the kitty on the phone 
First right, and down the hall you know your eyes are made out of stone 
So what do we do? Don't surrender your plans to a mismatched chameleon crook 
Got a novel, a plane, a train, some pain, and your favorite children's book 
Do it up, chameleon man, do it up eon don 
The planet's intact from behind your back, if we could get to just moving along 
Won't you do it up? 
Chameleon man, do it up eon don 
The planet's arranged for the sick and the strange, if I could write it off in a song 

Stay home, lock the door and keep the seahorse safe in the tank 
Won't you do your best to turn your back on the world and take your money right outta the bank 
Ten times to bring you back and drop the sun on top of the moon 
Ten times to bring you back another Sunday afternoon 

So what do we do? 
Don't surrender your plans to a mismatched chameleon crook 
Got a novel, a plane, a train, some pain and your favorite children's book
