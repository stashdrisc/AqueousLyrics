ON THE EDGE
Feels like i’m going off the rails now
I’m not sure where my heads been at
Another few drinks couldn’t bring me down
Any lower than i’ve been baby, on the ground

Looking for love in the wrong place
That little voice couldn’t make it clear
At anytime I can get you down
Anytime I can get you down, now

I’m seeing stars again
And I’ll have to meet you there
Don’t bet on the wrong one, baby 
You’ve got no time to spare

Well I’m feeling different than i’ve ever felt before
I’m feeling like I’m on the edge

A little busted up in my head
Another few hours and I’ll hit the town
Looking for anything to make me feel but
Anything i'd borrow I could probably steal

Can I come down to your place?
I get this feeling it’s my only chance 
At anytime I can get you down 
Anytime I can get you down, now

I’m seeing stars again
And I’ll have to meet you there
Don’t bet on the wrong one, baby 
You’ve got no time to spare

Well I’m feeling different than i’ve ever felt before
I’m feeling like I’m on the edge

I’m seeing stars again
And I’ll have to meet you there
Don’t bet on the wrong one, baby 
You’ve got no time to spare

Cause you’ve got no time to spare

Cause you’ve got no time to spare
