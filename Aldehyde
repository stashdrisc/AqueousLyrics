Aldehyde

Take a look inside the test tube, to see what's inside 
Pull it out and put it on the plate 
Little aldehyde 

Another free man born just today, he's of the chemical kind 
You think it would have been a slimy, sloppy situation, or that's the allegation 
Knock knocks and ticking clocks is all that you hear 
Inside your head! 
Ya think it would have been a one-eyed seeing freak of nature 
With its own unique form of nomenclature 

Aldehyde you can't fool me	Aldehyde you were born to be free 

Throw it into the funnel then into the flask, and when the timing is right 
You will see with your two eyes	Little aldehyde 

Well he ran for a hundred, million, billion miles, to find the answers 
To the questions he had built up deep inside of him, like what it was to sin 
Knock knock jokes and greenish smokes are of nothing that he knew 
Poor aldehyde! 
He ran through forests, deserts, valleys, mountains, swam through oceans 
To find the devil's potions 

He was made in a laboratory, synthesized to be 
One to see and one to be free, what else would you need 
But he got bad and he lost his hair, and got a nasty burn 
Aldehyde what do you do now
