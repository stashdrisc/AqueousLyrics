Skyway

Some days I feel like I have been unplugged but 
my cord gets plugged back in, and I'm back again 
I feel that I don't really have control, I let it go 
but I guarantee that I'll get the job done 

My brain got fried, it's been on too long it needs a break 
but there's no time so I power back on again 
I'm sure that I'll forget about control and let it go 
but in due time, I'm back in line 

In this mess we call life, even if you can't relate 
I don't see any reason to get worked up, already got enough on my plate 
in this mess we call life, takin' it day by day 
I don't see any reason to get worked up when you got nothin' to say 
you never have nothin' to say 

My path is gone, I think it's obsolete or weathered down 
but I'm still crazed and true, and I know it's through 
I'm sure that I'll forget about control, then let it go 
but in due time, I lose my mind
