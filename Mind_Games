Mind Games

Crooked signs and street lights all just pass me by 
I slip inside your world that's quickly changing mine 
And it's alright because I got your back and you've got mine 
Just slip inside and groove your mind down 

So down I go	The sights and sounds that I've been shown 
They hypnotize	And cast a shadow on my eyes 
And I can't see 
You're making it perfectly clear to me 
That it's alright, that it's alright 

My mind breaks open like water in the sky 
My thoughts keep growing and changing all the time 
Like waters flowing I'll show you what's inside 
My thoughts keep growing and changing all the time
