King for a Day

Say what you wanted to say 
I've got a plan for the day 
running around for a while 
screaming the words with a smile 

We all know just why we're here, 
that's just what it seems 
up and down and in and out 
as fast as you can dream 

Saving the time in a jar 
stored in the trunk of my car 
locked it away for the sun 
waiting 'till spring has begun 

I'm all ears if you've got patience 
what it takes to understand 
this state of mind, this lack of grace, 
this brand new look upon my face
