The River

Gypsy man and gypsy woman going on a gypsy journey. 
Rollin’ up and rollin’ down, rollin' down a river. 
Searching for their magic place, a place beyond reality 
A place no one knows about or even wants to care about.

The mighty (mighty) river rolls on. 
The mighty (mighty) river rolls on.

When they arrived they knew they found a place along the out of bound. 
Rollin’ up and rollin’ down, rollin’ down a river 
With skies of green and skies of blue the river and the mountaintop 
They found their own utopia, a place to call their own.

The mighty (mighty) river rolls on. 
The mighty (mighty) river rolls on down.
