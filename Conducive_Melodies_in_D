Conducive Melodies in D

This is no different than what you'd expect to hear 
The sounds and melodies are all in line 
You'd think it was a crime 
I'd have to pay the fine 
That couldn't be more wrong 

There is no need to reply to this typical design 
As strange as it may seem, the words come naturally 
You'd think it was a fine line too big for me to cross 
That couldn't be more right 

Shapes and sounds are all the same 
New waters should come this way 

Bend the bars of the cage that hold you so inside
