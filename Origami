Origami

She speaks in something just like Chinese origami 
Twisting and shaping, confused, displacing 
She's got a full time job with something on the side 
It doesn't matter, got a free pass all the time 

She's got a muffin shop, it stays open past nine 
It's dark and sweaty; it's getting vandalized all the time 
She's got a customer who's been coming through for years 
He gets himself kicked out, man he don't speak Shakespeare 

I'm not looking to get back 
Don't want to have to dig two 
I'm not looking to get back 
Let Karma get to you (x2) 

She's like my favorite little Japanese knot weed 
Out in the open, but somehow gets around unseen 
She's got it made; she's got it figured out 
But every plant needs water man I think we're in the season of a draught, now 

You know that little shop, it stays open all the time 
With a neon sign so bright, that it must have made you blind 
But every way you look, it's showing something new 
And every single story's got an ending with a hero and a fool 

I'm not looking to get back 
Don't want to have to dig two 
I'm not looking to get back 
Let Karma get to you (x2)
