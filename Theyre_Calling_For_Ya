They're Calling for Ya

Consider the time that's spent in a day 
Time to throw out like minutes for pay 
Come on up man, come up and get down 
And move it all around without making a sound 

Your brain shorts out, you must tune in 
It's something you need, about to begin 
And all of the people line up like freaks 
Everybody's talking, but nobody speaks 

In this act you'll see it unfold 
A little overdone, or so I'm told 
With a beggars tale or a minstrel show 
As long as the flow is funktional 

But who told you to tell him to? 
I think you're confused, did the message get through? 
If anything's certain, if anything's true 
It's that somebody's calling, they're calling for you 

Now the world will spin as it will please 
It won't take care, it won't lose sleep 
And as it turns man we do too 
For better or worse, now it's up to you 
You're the talk of the town, the dunce and the crown 
A million miles away, but you're hearing the sound 
A message aloud, a call to the crowd 
Somebody's calling, they're calling for you 

Somebody's calling, somebody's calling for you
