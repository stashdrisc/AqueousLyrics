BURN IT DOWN

You went and called my bluff 
(Here we go again)
And everything’s on fire
(But no one really cares)
I tried to make it right
(I’ll never make it right)
I’m trippin’ on desire

Hey now, let me out
Set me free and burn it down
It takes ahold of me

Hey now, let it out
Set me free and burn it down
You’ve got that thing I need

I wasn’t seeing straight
(Feels like I never do)
All blue and crimson red
(The colors in my head)
Just let the fire burn
(Just let it burn, let it burn)
It burns inside my head

Hey now, let me out
Set me free and burn it down
It takes ahold of me

Hey now, let it out
Set me free and burn it down
You’ve got that thing I need
