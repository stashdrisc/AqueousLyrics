How High You Fly

Far beyond this crazy world
You say "What should I be?"
Gracefully, and full of life
You understand you're free

Joining all the others
Where the days are filled with light
"I could never fly so high; I finally made it right"

Meet each other on the way
What's it like to be there, anyway?
We all lost, but you have won
You made your mark on everyone
And now you've got to see how high you fly

Driving down the water line
I had the strangest thought
Two old friends, or so to speak
Had crossed the far beyond

And both could share a drink or two
And maybe they could see me too
And I'll be down here waiting for my time to run with you

Pay your debts, and pay your dues
Cause' we're not alone down here
And even though we've said goodbye
No we're not alone, down here
