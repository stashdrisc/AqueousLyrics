Dig It Good

I wake up every morning with a new look on my face 
Cause' every single morning got a new situation that's taking place 
One river's drying up today, one will be born tomorrow 
Patches are sown and some get torn, but they seem to relinquish all the sorrow

Supermarket concrete beach, but masked with the scent of skunk 
Wandering eyes will flock to the shores, the opportunity of getting drunk 
And there's no need to justify, and there's no need to forget 
As long as that you're sure it's here, as long as it's for many years 

Conceptualize this new age thought, but don't forget the past 
It's endlessly streaming out of the mind, the words that just go by in a flash 
Spending the moments til' the end, taking what you can 
Reforming the old back to the new, and forming gold from sand 

Kaleidoscope-like visions is all that most will see 
Shapes and sounds are all the same when presented in that way 
There's no need to justify, there's no need to forget 
You'd better dig into something good today and be free
