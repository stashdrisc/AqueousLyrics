Numbers and Facts

It's not my place to give advice 
Your world's been turning so fast 
You might not have the time you planned on 
When any day could be your last

To see this place through that lens 
It could go any way at all 
And it might not benefit or change you 
Reduce your walk to a crawl

And when the words escape and float around in space 
You'll be the first to know 
And you'll go, out on your own

Two sides to every coin 
Two ways to say it all 
Two reasons just to surprise you 
Two days and I could be gone

And there's always things you cannot say 
There's always words you can't take back 
And there's always something in the way 
There's always numbers and facts
