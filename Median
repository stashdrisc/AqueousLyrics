The Median

I've got this feeling that will probably get away from me 
but I will take it cause it's hardly ever there 
and it's so simple that you might not even realize 
it's so simple that you might not even care. 

And from the morning to the evening holding on to it 
because it's got me feeling like I'm really glued 
and I don't even care to know what was the cause of it 
or if it even matters that I haven't got a clue 

But maybe I, I didn't hear what you said then 
and maybe I think you've got it all wrong 
after all, I wasn't there when you did it but ya gotta know, gotta know 

That all these days turn in to one 
and all this light has just begun to shine 
let's take this time, and work it out 
'cause we've got time 

I'm not that sure just what it takes to make a proper plan 
I haven't got a clue what drives a person or a car 
my brain is just so different from the average median 
and everyday I probably take it too far 

So if my patience loses touch with your reality 
and I try to fit a circle to a square 
it's safe to say I'm losing touch with your reality 
which begs the question, should I care? 

But maybe I didn’t hear what you said then 
and maybe I think you've got me all wrong 
'cause after all, I wasn't there when you did it but ya gotta know, gotta know 

That all these days turn in to one 
and all this light has just begun to shine 
I’ll take this time, won’t wait it out because we've got time
