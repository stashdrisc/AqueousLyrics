Mice

How many wrongs until it's right 
How many times have we hit that light 
How many days inside my car 
If you couldn't hide your unsightly scar 
And it seems you've changed today 
But if the cat is gone the mice will play 
Nobody cares what you think 
And you make it better with the devil's drink 

And it's hard to say that nothing's changed 
But nothing could ever be the same 
Because of all the sins that you owe 
Well I don't believe that no one knows 
And will the true come back to haunt you 
I know the truth can set you free 
Or will the true come back to haunt you 
I know in time that we will see 

And who's to say what we were there for 
And who's to say what can't be said 
All the questions you couldn't answer 
All the thoughts inside my head 
But are you even being honest 
To yourself and to your friends 
No you're not even being honest 
It will come back to you again 

In time we learn to grow	(every time we pass go) 
And the ending no one knows	(when your true self shows) 
It's in the choices that you make	(it's more than a mistake) 
You only get what you take	
I know in time you'll break
