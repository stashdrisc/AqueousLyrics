COME AND GO

There’s an innocence in the air
Breathe it in
While some may be in a fog
I’m waiting for the sun to come along 

People come and people go
People come and people go

Like many times before
In and out
Where have you been?
Your patience has grown
Take what you’ve learned and let it go
Take what you’ve learned and let it go

People come and people go
People come and people go

So you ask me “what are you doing with your life?”
If there was a better way
You know I would take it, yeah!

People come and people go
People come and people go
People come and people go
People come and people go
