Strange Times

Strange times come to me, all my life it's all I see 
All at once or not at all, some cars big, some cars small 
I've been thinking, no more thinking, things get stranger if we're drinking 
Chasing dreams chase the demo; chase the things that make you sane 

Feel alright, I do today, whose strange thoughts are here to stay? 
What's the purpose of your purpose, who decides, who decides 
If I am, if you're not, thoughts don't ever seem to stop 
Gravitating slowly to the center of the earth 

I can't shut my brain off long enough to even see 
That the simplest solution was there waiting just for me 
Like a satellite subdued, like a picture in the clouds 
All the logic in the world couldn't even help me now 

Moving through the fog and haze, incoherent through the day 
Colors moving, shaping twisting, turning till it's most displacing 
From this view I can't relate, time and space control my fate 
All in all it's nice I mean it's great I mean it's good 

Through and through, all around, sometimes I can't make a sound 
Someone left the door wide open, thoughts spilled out onto in the floor 
If you feel like passing by, don't forget to ask me why 
We're gravitating slowly towards the center of the earth 

I can't shut my brain off long enough to even see 
That the simplest solution was there waiting just for me 
Like a satellite subdued, like a picture in the clouds 
All the logic in the world couldn't even help me now 
Because I can't stop, won't stop 

I can't shut my brain off long enough to even see 
That the simplest solution was there waiting just for me 
Like a satellite subdued, like a picture in the clouds 
All the logic in the world, couldn't even help me now 
Help me now	Help me now
