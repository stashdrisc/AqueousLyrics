Mosquito Valley Part II (two)


It's all around us, can't you feel it?

It's systematic, it's alright, if you don't understand the purpose

And our ideas have got us this far, but just as easy we can fall

We walk a fine line through that forest, and I know time; you'll have seen it all

When it's time to sink or swim

You gotta use your thoughts within

Will you stay or will you fight?

You gotta do what you know is right

 

If your perspective ever changes, I'm sure by then it'll be too late

With all the lies that you've relied on, it will by then have sealed your fate

And if you look to the skies and wonder, "Just how long til we get it right?"

And no one said that it would be easy, I think you'll know by the end of the night

 

When you don't have enough to say

You gotta use what you learned today

Will you stay or will you fight?

You gotta do what you know is right
