Underlyer

Light changes shape 
from the side of the glass 
Power lines divide us all 

Light changes shape 
from the side of the glass 
Power lines divide us all 

I see you all strung up 
In someone else's light 
A path you're forced to walk 
A fight you're forced to fight 
There's nothing noble there' 
Cause you been put on the line 
A sudden war to wage 
Its meant to twist your spine 

It's hidden well beneath 
the ruse of such good times 
The underlyer is the reason 
Why we live or die 
The stakes are higher now 
Than anybody knows 
They're there to take you in 
or let it come to blows 

If I feel it coming on 
and I'm just beside myself 
I cannot go another day 
I never lose control 
Two thirds of my own soul 
To re-divide another way 

Light changes shape 
from the side of the glass 
Power lines divide our soul 

Light changes shape 
from the side of the glass 
Power lines divide us all 

The path to justice is 
Covered in sad goodbyes 
A fleeting memory 
A piece of your old life 
It's not your game to play 
But still you hold the dice 
And now you've got the gun 
to cast in your own light 

If I feel it coming on 
and I'm just beside myself 
I cannot go another day 
And I never lose control 
Two thirds of my own soul 
To re-divide another way 

If something's painted white 
It's never what it seems 
A passing glance another chance 
To show you what it means 
If something's painted black 
Well who then holds the brush? 
It's not your creation now? 
It's not your creation now?? 

If I feel it coming on 
and I'm just beside myself 
I cannot go another day 
And I never lose control 
Two thirds of my own soul 
To re-divide another way
