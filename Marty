Marty

Good old Marty takes the bus to school everyday 
Got his calculator so he's doing okay 
In his mind he brachiates with marmosets and dogs and snakes 

Good old Marty clean and neat, sits down in his favorite seat 
Far away but keeping time, desk drum roots within his spine 
All the while I watch him there, tap away without a care 
Head on loose he speaks no words just living life with the moon flock herd 

Marty what you got in that bag? 
And what will you do tomorrow? 
Marty what you got in that bag? 
And I will heed the answer to whatever it is you say 

Good old Marty's red balloons, take him to his spaceship soon 
If all the cats and dogs came too he'd sing himself a morning tune 
Now he's set for two whole weeks I see it in his rosy cheeks 

Marty likes to plan ahead 
Plotting with his best friend ted 
Not part of the human race 
A person or a thing or place 
All the while I watched him there, tap away without a care 
Head on loose he leads the herd conversing with his favorite bird 

Red Balloons are falling from the sky	Red Balloons take Marty up so high
