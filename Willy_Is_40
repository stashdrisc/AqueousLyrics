Willy is 40 (forty)

What do I need to know?	When do I start to live? 

And if it means what I think it means I guess I'd better get to living 
I suppose I've kicked around for long enough 

What do I need to know?	When do I start to live? 

And if the stars, they won't align 
I'll have to double back and cut the line 
I'm breaking off, from all my ties 

What do I need to know?	When do I start to live? 

I know the starts, they won't align 
And now I double back to look at the signs 
I'm breaking off from all my ties 

Has it always been so clear? 
Has it always been so obvious but we just couldn't hear? 
And has it always been so dull? 
The sun blocked from day to day
