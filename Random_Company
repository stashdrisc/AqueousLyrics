Random Company

I don't tend to agree with your state of being 
I don't see how you see, I prefer the random company 

All night, you walk through the crowd 
You're wild, dedicated, loud 
Your horse, it's taller than the rest 
Your horse, it's never second best 

You may find yourself searching for another way, too late, by then too late. 
You may realize we're all here to seize the day today by then too late.

Pretense; you know you're headed for the stars 
But your head, can't fit through doors of bars 
We don't share your point of view 
We don't see the world like you
