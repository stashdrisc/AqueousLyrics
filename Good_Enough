Good Enough

Bow to the master
And give in to the rule
When it's all getting faster
There's really nothing I can do

And Hail to the power
God damn, is it me?
If this is my real life
Why does it feel like a dream?

Living on a shoestring
And counting change in the jar
And on a Monday or a Tuesday
Singing "Fuck the alarm"

If I'm in my head again
And I'm noticing what's wrong
I just realized the problem
It was me, all along

Running so fast, but I'm thinking so slow
Got my sights set high but I'm feeling..
So low

I'm floating on the wind
But what else can I say?
I float along, alone
I float there everyday

A solitary flight
A secret that I've known
I keep it all done up
I'm floating all alone

I'm guilty in my own way
Another day slipping' by
A frequent flyer on the phone screen
Pretend we're never gonna' die

I've been dealing with the problem
And getting used to the thought
Another solemn reminder
Another lesson I was taught

Running so fast, but I'm thinking so slow
Got my sights set high but I'm feeling..
So low

How do I say what I need to say
And get out of my head and start living..
Today
