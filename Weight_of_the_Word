Weight of The Word: 
Gravy, we'll eat it up and lick the plate
Can't believe the taste these days
So save me, a seat up front to see the play
and they'll make your day

Now the flowers are all red and blue
But stand on the same shade of green
You say, what we say, is all we say
What is, and what should never be

I've heard that the weight of the word
Is getting too much to take
While it stands and demands that my back won't bend
My back may break

In dreams, it seems that the words melt away
Up above or down below
You better make your get away
I'm scared, i'm spread so thin that I might slip through the cracks

If you could see that the door's unlocked 
You might run away
If you could see that there's so much more
Than these re-run plays

Go on and on, ghosts will come and ghosts will go
Go on and on, ghosts move fast cause' they all know..
