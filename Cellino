Cellino

You never looked into the mirror, before you went to work 
You never wondered why your face hung from every building in town 
And you never wonder why 

You never were concerned with tying ties or shoes or colorful balloons 
Always basking in the light and looking towards the back of the room 
And you never wonder why	
And so he cried 

If you only knew	
Poor Jimbo 
He never knew 
That jail could be so cruel 

You never really noticed that everything, everything had turned to grey 
Everything had a touch of orange and black, and a hint of decay 
Your partner kept things straight while you were out and away 
He was quite the man I'm sure, but he never did capture your sway 

He was young and didn't know what was to come 
Come inside stranger, all the lights point you home 
Locks and chains are lifted, and walls are broken down 
One man stands as the second one follows beside him now
