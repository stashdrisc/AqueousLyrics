Calling Out

So many thoughts today 
It’s hard to keep it straight 
What’s it need to say, who’s it gonna play

Sunset, when I wake up 
Oh I feel it 
Regardless of how it may appear, I adhere

To what I am told 
When the grass is greener I say no 
I only aim to please

A pain inside 
Grinded down, open up wide 
Somethings coming out

I don’t know, I don't know, I don’t know why I leave it up to me 
This misdirection has somehow healed the infection 
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know how long it’ll last 
It seemed to come about much too fast

Never knowing, never showing 
Still that voice inside is calling out 
Calling out

For me it’s one at a time 
No more, no less 
Trying to get to the finish line 
Trying to avoid the stress

Too much, too soon 
Why can’t I be immune 
Time to release and find some inner peace

I don’t know, I don’t know, when I think don’t look to me 
It was a simple task and why did no one ask? 
Well I know, well I know, well I know that there’ll come a day 
When I speak my thoughts and just let it be

Oh I’m calling out to you 
Too much, too soon 
Oh I’m calling out to you

It’s written on my hand 
“Words are like grains of sand” 
Too many, too soon 
And it’s my fantasy to live in ecstasy

And that is why
