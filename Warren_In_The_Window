Warren in the Window

In the evening, when everyone else is inside 
You're staring in the window 
Waiting for a year to pass so you can come inside 
But now it's alright 
Cause' even with the strange demands, well they were all alright 
And now it's all good- 

I know you're out there 
A hundred million people pass you by 
And we know, that cause' you stayed around that you would live outside 
And now it's alright 
Cause' even with the strange demands, well they were all alright 
And now it's all good- 

You've got the right idea but you're out there in the world 
And if the years won't pass in a big white flash, if you wait, you will be heard 
Till then my friend, keep dancing like the spider monkey do 
And someday we're gonna see you, from another point of view 

We know you're out there	Cause' all the crazy people walked on by 
And you knew, that if you stayed around that you could live outside 
And if it's alright 
Cause' even with the strange demands, well they we're all alright 
So now we're all good 

You've got the right idea but you're out there in the world 
And if the years won't pass in a big white flash, if you wait, you will be heard 
Until then my friend, keep dancing like the spider monkey do 
And someday we're gonna see you, from another point of view
