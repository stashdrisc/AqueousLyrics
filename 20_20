20/20 (Twenty Twenty)

Where have the real emotion's gone? 
Has it been this way for so long? 
Now, it doesn't seem like its ever gonna change. 
If it was easy it would be easy. 
If it was simple it would be simple. 
Simple. Simple? Simply split in two! 
Momentum of mountains don't move you. 

Your plastic journey in 2020 
Is your pseudo trip seen clearly? 

If I understood I would understand. 
If I had another limb it'd be another hand. 
If I could read it would be between your lines. 
If I could make it, oh I'd make more time. 

Your plastic journey in 2020 
Is your pseudo trip seen clearly? 
Your plastic journey in 2020 
Is it funny that it’s sunny when you’re seen sincerely? 

He's only flapping his gums, 
But I mistook it for a gun 
If you ain't got a heart then there ain't no blood 
But now, how will you be seen when its all said and done? Ohhh! 

In cars and trains the words just seem to fade and slip away 
its like the smoke from a cigarette, which lingers briefly. 
Your fingers breathe the air. 

If cars and trains and words just seem to fade and slip away. 
Just like the smoke from your cigarette that lingers freely, lingers free in the air 
lingers free in the air

Ohhh!
