Phase III (three 3)

I've got some change to spare, if you have got the time 
A penny I could share, if you'll commit the crime 
And do what you will do, but keep it all inside 
Assume the role again, but don't pick sides 

Another life I see, has got away again 
You'll see it in your dreams; you'll see how it'll end 
And myths will turn to fact, old walls will crumble down 
Some things remain intact, some things are not around 

Will something signify, will it all come to be in time? 
Could you please clarify, I'd like to try and see the signs 
The truth won't make it clear but you can try and help me here 
Could you please clarify I'd like to try and see the signs 

The times are changing boy; you'd better get on top 
And sell your soul way, and watch the others drop 
Yeah put that smile on, but never meet the eye 
It's all you've gotta do, don't even have to try 

It's just a numbers game; it's just a state of mind 
We'll get behind the blame, and put our faith in time 
We're keeping tabs on everyone; you'd better watch the pack 
You didn't realize the knife was in your back 
Will something signify, will it all come to be in time? 
Could you please clarify, I'd like to try and see the signs 
The truth won't make it clear but you can try and help me here 
Could you please clarify I'd like to try and see the signs
