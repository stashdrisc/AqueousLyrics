In It (For Me)

When there's nothing left to take
Wondering simply what to make
Of the feeling that's around
Soon you'll be buried in the ground

It's all so loud, yet hard to hear
Nothings ever been less clear
Everyone has gone to bed
Everybody left for dead

No time to kill, no space to fill

What will you do, when life comes at you?
You say, "What is in it for me?"

Now I am afraid to say
Whatâ€™s been on my mind for days
Disenchanted with the old ways
Subdivided we must stay

It's what lies beneath, the talk is cheap
No mystery, re-write history

What will you do, when life comes at you?
You say, "What is in it for me?"
