Half In, Half Out

When you break it down
It's funny what you might see
When you're the talk of the town
Is it science or philosophy?

Red roses, adorn the highway
They brought it all into frame
No things are not all the same

In the light of the day
In the dark of the night
Images start to turn grey
That before were black and white

Red roses, from me to you
To whom it may concern
You'll have to wait your turn
And bridges may burn 

How much you take will be what you deserve
Take it slow now, don't be lazy, you should be heard

It all sounds so familiar, half in and half out
And then you'll run

Armed with all words to say
Still, it's easy to lose your way
After years and miles have passed
What stands is what will last

Red roses, given birth to your worth
But together they work
It's Heaven, Hell and the Earth

Half in, half out
It's been a long day
Half in, half out
It's sometimes sad to say
