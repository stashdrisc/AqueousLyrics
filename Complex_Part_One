Complex Part I (one)

Rain all day, and sleep all night is what they'll say 
I lay down the plan and lead the race 
minds they go, when you think about the past 
if memories keep slipping through, could you make it last? 

Clouds hang low, and the sun has turned its back 
and it's hard to keep your head up, if you see just what you lack 
still the sun in some respects, a change can pave the way 
and it's not clear, but have no fear, it's coming any day 

A change in the way, that you think and feel 
thrown to the wind, and the path gets sealed 
changing the way, that you think and feel 
thrown to the wind, and the path gets sealed
