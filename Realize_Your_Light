Realize Your Light

Clear your mind
Clear the day
It doesn't matter what you said before
All in good time we'll see the end

Let it in
Let it out
Don't take what you don't need
We wander until we plant the seed

And we can see where this can go
Around the corner is still unknown
And all the time that slips away
Will come back to you someday

Just for today
Just for you
Lay your body down and soothe your soul
Reduce the things that take their toll on you

Run with me
Or run alone
No need to fight, make the day bright
Take the time and realize your light

And we can see where this can go
In chilling snow, the thrill can still grow 
And if the back is all you read
Your words won't succeed 

And all the time that slips away
Will come back to you
Someday 

Be anything
Not just anything
Realize your light
Like a spark in the night
