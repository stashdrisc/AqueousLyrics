Kitty Chaser (Explosions)

I've got an eye for nothing 
And everything at once 
Depending on the hour 
I see things from high up 
I look down and I look out 
People come and they go 
The business to my right is growing so well on its own 
And through the plastic red I see
A family of 19 
But by tomorrow you can bet 
Another family tree 
They're always on the clock but 
You'll never see them go 
It happens in the darkness 
That way you'd never know 

Explosions in the sky 
Reflected in their eyes 
Another way to get to know the tiny street you live on 
Explosions in the sky 
Rejoice because no one died 
Another way to get to know the tiny street you live on 

And I exchange most everyday 
Just while the children sing 
watch for glass beneath your feet 
and there's one other thing 
A few blocks down they turned around 
But it won't be too long 
Until they shift and spin 
And sing another country's song
