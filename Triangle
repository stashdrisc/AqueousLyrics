Triangle

Sitting here and I'm thinking, wondering, dreaming, I don't know 
The eyes are closing now and the words are closing too 

Time sure passing slow treated as an equal 
When you already know that you will not be chosen 
Strange and obscure thoughts cloud your mind 
They shape you and spin you around 

Well I'm sinking down, well I'm sinking now
