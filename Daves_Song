Dave's Song

You might find sunshine in a box 
But then all the people will start to talk 
Of what they've found at the end of the day 
But then I would have to say 
That you would have to be insane 
To stand in the pouring rain 
And I wish that I could know	
All there is to know 

Waiting on a painting of the sun 
To fall on to the lawn 
And if it burns all you know 
Then there's nothing left to show 
But the world so upside down 
Spinning along and around 
And I wish that I could see	
All there is to see 

Know, there is to know	Know, there is to know
