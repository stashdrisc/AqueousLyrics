Color Wheel:

Fell into the dream 
Of the information stream
The world inside
The other world you hold

In spite of all the grey 
On your color wheel today
You do your best
But you can't look away

Running the Race
Standing in Place

Blue just seems to grow
But you never let it show
Behind your eyes
A disconnected Ghost

It's easy to pretend
when we're living in this age
of exaggeration, pure-perfection fakes

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
You're hanging on to what's inside
But if the color red, would get into my head
And paint the inside of my mind...


Gazing Down Below
At the incandescent Glow
The solitude devoid of dreams and hopes

The void it calls again
and you think that it's your friend
But light is fading fast and it's the end

Running the Race
Standing in Place
