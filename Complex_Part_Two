Complex Pt. II (Part Two)

I'm used to feeling strange and feeling twice my age, 
I have to sell and buy my time 
I'm through with making sense 
and being on the fence and standing in the longest line 


10 (ten) to the day and 20 (twenty) to the night 
pay the man 30 (thirty) or more til it feels right 
in the morning when i start again 
and my own fascinations are my new best friend 

Ooohhh wooo-ooooh 

I'm feeling right again and I dont know how long it's been 
things are now returning to the places that I left for them 
and when the tables turn exactly like they always do 
wait for me to find my way and meet you on the other side 

Some lines are hard to see 
And I dont even know who I'm supposed to be, 
but I think I'll ride this train along (ride this train along) 
and in the light of the day with all the words you say 
I always know what's right and wrong (right and wrong) 

Woooo-oooahhh 

10 to the day and 20 to the night
