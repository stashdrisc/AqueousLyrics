Second Sight

I'm keeping on the track
No need to settle scores
No time is like the present
Presently counting yours

I recognize the right
To live and breathe and see
Do you recognize the difference
From how it used to be?

Falling, astounded; reveals who we are
Down to the bottom, again from the start

Sought to Divide, Strive to Unite
We're as one, as you are one
And you'd wish for second sight

Not worth it's weight in gold
I feel a great divide
We're more alike than different
And still we're picking sides

So now we speak the words
That put us all at odds
And we're just wasting time
And we're just playing god

Guilty of silence, is guilty the same
What can we say when we all share the blame?
